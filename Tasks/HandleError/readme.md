demonstrates exception handling with vectors in C++:

Create a vector of integers.
Ask the user to enter a series of integers and store them in the vector.

Implement error handling to catch the following exceptions:
If the read operation of the vector size exceeds the max vector limit.
Handle the exceptions by displaying the error message and allowing the user to re-enter the input or terminate the program gracefully.
