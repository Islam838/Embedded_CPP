implement a program that demonstrates the usage of static_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast in C++:

Create a function called "convertValue" that takes an integer parameter.
Inside the function, use static_cast to convert the integer to a float and print the result.
Use reinterpret_cast to convert the integer to a pointer and print the address it points to.

Declare a constant integer variable and assign it a value.
Use const_cast to remove the const qualifier from the variable and modify its value.
Print the modified value of the variable.
